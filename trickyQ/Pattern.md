Patterns 

pattern 3

You need to take an integer input and then draw the pattern according to it. Say for example if you enter 5 then, the pattern should be like this-
1 1 1 1 1
2 2 2 2 2
3 3 3 3 3
4 4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5 5

Input Format
You will take an integer input n from stdin.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 1000

Output Format
Your output should be the pattern according to the input which you had entered. 



Pattern 5

1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5

Input Format
You will take an integer input  n from stdin.

Constraints
1 < = n < = 1000

Output Format
Your output should be the pattern according to the input which you had entered. 

pattern 4
